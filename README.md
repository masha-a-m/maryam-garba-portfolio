### My Process
First, I did a research on different UIs before settling on the one I wanted to use. Then, I set up my working environment which includes installing the react npm because I wanted to use React for the project. I also installed Tailwind so that I can use it for styling my UI. Then I went on to create components(navbar, footer, hero section, project details) and pages(homepage, about page, projects page), before adding them to the app.js.

### Built With
React
Tailwind CSS

### What I Learnt
This project taught me a lot on building responsive UIs with React. I learnt how to implement components and render them in the project. I also learnt some simple animations which I used for the hero section.

### Deployment
The website was deployed via Vercel. The link can be found here:
